      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m restarting my blog! It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since I&amp;rsquo;ve last written a post. I was full of excuse. Life has been busy, I have a 18 month old son. Work has been busy, isn&amp;rsquo;t for everyone? My old blogging platform, custom built Django setup, was horrible to write in. I could have made it all work if I made it a priority but I didn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m resetting. New look, new platform (Hugo), and new thoughts. I&amp;rsquo;m going to be writing more often about more topics. Some of the blog posts are going to be shorter, like this one. I&amp;rsquo;m going to be blogging about new topics like managing, data science &amp;amp; analysis, in addition to programming and any other thoughts that I have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
