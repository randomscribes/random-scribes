I'm restarting my blog! It's been a long time since I've last written a post. I was full of excuse. Life has been busy, I have a 18 month old son. Work has been busy, isn't for everyone?<!--more--> My old blogging platform, custom built Django setup, was horrible to write in. I could have made it all work if I made it a priority but I didn't.

So I'm resetting. New look, new platform (Hugo), and new thoughts. I'm going to be writting more often about more topics. Some of the blog posts are going to be shorter, like this one. I'm going to be blogging about new topics like managing, data science & analysis, in addition to programming and any other thoughts that I have.

I hope you enjoy.
