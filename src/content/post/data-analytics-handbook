- A four part series focusing on analytics. CEOs and Managers, Big Data, Data Analyst & Data Science, Researchers & Analytics,
- Interviews with various analytics academics and professionals (Yelp, Google, LinkedIn,  etc)
- Questions such as
-- What's the difference between *data scientist* and *data analyst*?
--- Most claim data analysts don't program, others claim there'should a huge overlap and no real difference.
--- They also dive into the difference between Data engineer and Data scientist with the data engineer being more of a rogrammer than a statistician.
-- what do you look for when hiring?
-- how do you see the industry evolving?
-- what are the important skills for young analytic professionals to learn?

- Focus on the three pillars data science, programming, visualization, statistics. All agree you  really need all 3 although their seems to be a lack of statistical knowledge in general throughout society
-The importance of communication cannot be stressed enough. If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around does it make a sound? If an analysis is given, but not communicatedo well was anything really learned?
- It's not overly polished  (lack of a publisher would do that). There are grammatical and syntactical errors that for the most part are easy to overlook.
- The book mimics a series of interviews that I have read previously ... The Data Analytics Handbook is a little more repetitive with some of the same questions like the difference between Data Scientists and Data AnalystsAnalyst seeing seed over and over 
- they Discuss the lack of data scientists and analysts. How are we going to fill the open Jobs? Is technology going to make a significant  impact?
- A data scientist is someone who is a better programmer than statisticians and knows more about statistics than a programmer.


- I see data scientists as a more advanced data analyst. It's interesting to hear from Tom Wheeler who believes otherwise.
