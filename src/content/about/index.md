Hey! I'm Steven. That's me over there with my beautiful wife and young son. I started this blog to start sharing my experiences. I am a big believer in reflecting on thoughts & ideas. This blog is a way to force myself to do so. Hopefully along the way I inspire thought in a few others and the world get's a just a microfraction of a percent (?) better.

A little bit about myself. I grew up in a small town in Saskatchewan, Canada and am now living in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. I've been programming since 2004, doing analytics since 2010, and data analysis since 2012. I'm currently employed by one of the best employers in Saskatoon, [Vendasta](https://www.vendasta.com) as the Director of Business Intelligence. I have a degree in Computer Science and a degree in Commerce. I love studying, reading, and listening to podcast about anything related to data analysis and statistics, programming, managing and organization theory.
