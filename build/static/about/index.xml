      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey! I&amp;rsquo;m Steven. That&amp;rsquo;s me over there with my beautiful wife and young son. I started this blog to start sharing my experiences. I am a big believer in reflecting on thoughts &amp;amp; ideas. This blog is a way to force myself to do so. Hopefully along the way I inspire thought in a few others and the world get&amp;rsquo;s a just a microfraction of a percent (?) better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little bit about myself. I grew up in a small town in Saskatchewan, Canada and am now living in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. I&amp;rsquo;ve been programming since 2004, doing analytics since 2010, and data analysis since 2012. I&amp;rsquo;m currently employed by one of the best employers in Saskatoon, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vendasta.com&#34;&gt;Vendasta&lt;/a&gt; as the Director of Business Intelligence. I have a degree in Computer Science and a degree in Commerce. I love studying, reading, and listening to podcast about anything related to data analysis and statistics, programming, managing and organization theory.&lt;/p&gt;
